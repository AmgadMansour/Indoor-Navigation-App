# Indoor-Navigation-App
This project aims to provide a reliable indoor navigation system. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is 
the navigation system used worldwide. However, GPS doesn't give accurate results indoors. Therefore, Bluetooth 
smart sensors are used instead, since their Received Signal Strengt h Indicator (RSSI) can be used to determine distances.
Knowing the locations of each beacon, the location of a user c an be approximated. The project is implemented as an Android application
backed by a server implemented using Ruby on Rails framework and SQLite database engine. 
The communication between the two sides is achieved using JSON.
